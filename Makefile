#  ---- NOTES ----

 #@ - to not display in console the command forwarded by this char
 #$ - like a variable declaration
 #$@ is the name of the target being generated
 #$< the first prerequisite (usually a source file)
 #.PHONY: - one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is just a name for a recipe to be executed


#GIT UPLOAD COMMANDS (as they appear in the beginning of a new repo):
 #echo "# Repo_test" >> README.md
 #git init
 #git add README.md
 #git commit -m "first commit"
 #git branch -M main
 #git remote add origin https://github.com/IDC87/Repo_test.git
 #git push -u origin main

 #…or push an existing repository from the command line
 #git remote add origin https://github.com/IDC87/Repo_test.git
 #git branch -M main
 #git push -u origin main

#GIT GENERAL COMMANDS:
 #git rev-parse HEAD - shows the last sha key 
 # git remote get-url origin - shows my current url origin
 # git remote show origin - almost the same, with more details
 # git remote -v - view all the remotes of current repository
 # git remote rm origin - remove current git url in origin
 # git push --set-upstream origin master - set the current url as upstream
